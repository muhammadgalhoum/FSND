# The Casting Agency Project with it's API Documentation

The Casting Agency models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. I'm an Executive Producer within the company and am creating a system to simplify and streamline my process.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Developers using this project should already have Python3 and pip installed on their local machines.

## Backend

Set up a virtual environment by running this command `python -m venv env`, then to activate the virtual environment by running this command `.\env\Scripts\activate`.  

From the main directory run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements.txt file.

To run the application run the following commands:

```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
set FLASK_DEBUG=true
flask run --reload
```

The application is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

### Tests

In order to run tests, open new terminal and make sure you are in the main directory in front of `test
_app.py` file  run the following command:

```bash
python test_app.py
```

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.
